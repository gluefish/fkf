<p align="justify">I want to be a teacher so I can help children improve their lives. As a high school student I went to see my counselor about going to college. He looked at my records, which were not very good, and told me that I would never attend college and that he was only there to help college-bound students. I felt that they were only there for the students they thought would go to college. I dropped out that same day and enrolled in the local adult education program and got my GED. Later I attended community college and now I am at the University of Texas at Arlington.</p>
<p align="justify">During my internship I hope first, to learn practical teaching strategies and second, to develop positive role model characteristics for the students. I will use the internship to gain knowledge for my future teaching career. I want to use the theory I have learned in the classroom and apply it to my own pedagogy. My greatest asset as an intern will be my desire to reach and positively affect students of all kinds.</p>
<p align="justify">I have had a lot of experience in the classroom, working as a teacher&#39;s assistant in an ESL classroom in an elementary school. I have also worked as a teacher&#39;s assistant in Juvenile Court schools and I have been a teacher&#39;s assistant in high school and middle school. I also tutored adults and young children in English as a Second Language while I lived in Spain. My love for the field of teaching has grown out of these experiences.</p>
<p align="justify">My favorite grade level is middle school. While I worked at Jackson Middle School I discovered that this age group was the one going through the most transition in their lives and on whom I could have the greatest affect. Middle school is where I personally changed the most, and I recall a very special counselor who had a positive affect on my life. I remember during this time feeling that I was not one of the students that the school was really there for even with the counselor&#39;s input. What I really needed was just one teacher to reach out to me but I never had that. I know a lot of students at college say, &quot; I can remember that one teacher who reached out for me and changed my life. &quot;  I want to be that teacher who influences the lives of her students for the better.</p>
<p align="justify">I had a love for books as a child and I was always reading. What I read was not necessarily things for school. I believe that my love for reading is what made it possible for me to succeed in college. When I took my entrance exam at the community college my reading and comprehension scores where high. Because of the skill I had already gained through reading I was able to do well in my college classes. Through dedication, hard work, and many hours spent in tutorials I can say that I am a success and I want to pass my secrets of success on to the students I teach. I believe I can do this best by teaching literature. I believe that literature helps us learn about our world, evaluate our priorities, and teaches us to communicate by modeling how to write.</p>
<p align="justify">I am not the typical college student, I am among a growing trend of adults who are married, over thirty, and have children. The time that I am not studying or in classes is dedicated to my family. I enjoy taking photographs of my family and putting them in scrapbooks. I am also a Girl Scout leader for my daughter&#39;s troop and I take my children to Karate classes and competitions. We just started horseback riding lessons. My biggest accomplishment was being inducted into the two year community college honor society, Phi Theta Kappa, and graduating with my Associates of Arts degree with that honor.</p>
<p align="justify">Teaching has been my life-long dream and that dream is becoming a reality. I finally feel that I will be able to fulfill my purpose in life by becoming an educator. I look forward to dedicating myself to the field of education and touching the lives of the students I encounter.</p>				</td>
