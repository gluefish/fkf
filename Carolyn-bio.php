    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p>I
      was born May 23, 1948 in Lowell, Mass., the third in a family of ten
      children. &nbsp;My
        father was an Industrial Mathematician, specializing in designing guidance
        systems for the Aerospace Industry. &nbsp;My
          mother had earned a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Zoology when she married,
          and  eventually earned a Masters Degree and a Doctorate in Clinical
          Psychology. &nbsp;I
            was raised in the San Fernando Valley. As the third oldest of ten
            children, I helped to care for my younger siblings, and did a lot of
            house work. I went to a Catholic Parochial school from the third grade
            through the seventh. I was the &ldquo;good&rdquo; child. I did whatever
            work my mother asked me to without resistance or protest, to please
            her. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>When
        I was seventeen, after going steady for a year, I became pregnant
        and dropped out of High School to marry my fianc&eacute;, Robert F.
        Davis. After four years and eight months and three children I divorced
        him and moved in with Mom. &nbsp;I
          began attending college, and got my AA degree from Los Angeles Valley College
      in 1973. </p>
      <p>I attended Cal State Univ. Northridge
          for two years, and then married W. Ronald Elterman in 1975. &nbsp;After
          a couple of years we moved to Virginia. We traveled by two cars with 
          three children, six goats, two dogs and a cat. It took
          us eleven days to get there, camping along the way. I  planned the
          trip carefully and had made arrangements to stay at fairgrounds so
          we had a place to keep the goats. &nbsp;About
            six months after we arrived in Virginia, Ron and I separated. We had
      a difference of goals and purposes, so we agreed to split up. </p>
      <p>I worked
        to support my kids and myself but was making very little money. I
        decided to seek child support. He responded by suing me for custody.
        We made a written agreement about the children. Linda and Lance would
        stay with him and Kim would stay with me. Lance and Kim would stay
        with me for a month at The Farm, a commune with 1300 people in Tennessee
        I joined, and then visit him for three months for the summer, and then
        Kim would come back to live with me. 
        He
        failed to keep the agreement, so I took him to court. The
        judge found him in contempt, but placed the kids with him
        and set a date for a custody hearing. At the hearing, the
        judge said, &ldquo;I think the
        children should learn to compete in the real world, so
        I am awarding custody to the father.&rdquo;&nbsp;I
          had a severe emotional reaction to losing my kids. I
          lost 30 pounds in about two months. The people at The Farm
          advised me to go home to my family so they could take care
          of me. They were afraid they would have to hospitalize me
          for my weight loss, which they didn&rsquo;t
      have the funds for. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>I
        returned to California. I worked for a few months as
        a nanny. This job ended when the children I was caring
        for went to live with their mother.&nbsp; I went to Chico
        and began attending college again. I studied computer
        science for about two years. Then I met my third husband,
        John Derry, who was a senior studying computer science.
        He graduated and we moved to Redwood City, where we
      were married in 1984. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>By
        this time my older daughter Linda had come back to live with me. She
        was seventeen. When she was eighteen, John and I drove to Virginia
        to pick up Lance and Kim for a summer visit. While we were away 
        Linda got married. Lance went back to his father to finish high school
        and then joined the Navy, and Kim stayed with me. I worked as an office
        clerk for about a year, and had a licensed family day care at home for
      about a year.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We
        decided to move back to Chico, and I worked for
        a year in a childcare center, then I returned to
        college, this time to study English. I graduated
        in 1988. By this time I had two grandchildren. It
      took me 18 years to get my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Shortly
      after I graduated, John and I separated. I moved in with my younger daughter
      Kim. </p>
      <p>After I met Lou, I moved to an apartment
          next door. My other daughter was also living in the same apartment
          building, so we had a cozy family thing going on. Linda and Kim had
          babies within ten days of each other, and they sometimes nursed each
          other&rsquo;s
          baby. I worked as a bus driver for the city of Chico and county
        of Butte for two years. &nbsp;I
        met Lou through my mother, and he moved to Chico
        from Los Angeles to live with me. We were married
      about a year after we moved in together, in 1990.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>We
        moved to Felton when he got a contract with Borland,
        his first computer contract job in 1994. This
        job made a big improvement in our finances. &nbsp;We
        bought 20 acres of land in Montana in 1995.
      We sold the property later. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Lou
        and I moved to Sedona in 1998, and bought
        a house in Cottonwood in February 1999. It
        was the first home we owned together. We bought
        a second house in 2001 in Cornville, 7 miles
        from Cottonwood. It was a 3300 square foot
        duplex with 1.6 acres of irrigated grassy land.
        I kept chickens and sheep there. Linda and
        her family move into the back half and Lou
        and I moved into the front half. The place
        was a fixer-upper. We repainted the outside
        and made numerous repairs and improvements.
        Lou&rsquo;s contract ended when we were moving in and there was
        a slump in the job market, so he didn&rsquo;t find
        another contract for six months, so we let
      the houses go to foreclosure. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>In
        April 2002 Lou got a contract at Symantec in Springfield, Oregon
        and we moved there. Linda found a house to rent in Cornville, and
      she continued to go to Yavapai College and work part time. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Lou
      has one daughter, Andreia. She was born in 1973.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>My
        daughter Linda was born March 12, 1966.
        She is married to a Native American,
        Rodney Boyer, and has three kids; Kevin Coulston,
        (who lives on his own) Kateland Coulston and Adam Smith.
        Kateland has a baby girl, Zoe, born April
        10, 2008. Linda&rsquo;s family and Lou
        and I all live together in a large 109-year-old
        house in Woodburn, Oregon.&nbsp;Rodney
        has two boys; Anthony lives with
        us, and Rylind, who lives with Rodney&rsquo;s mother
      on a reservation. </p>
      <p> My
        son Lance Davis was born June 5, 1967,
        he is married to Emy, whom he met
        in the Philippines. She has a son,
        Joey Suyat whom Lance raised as his own.
        Joey is married and has a baby
        boy, David, born June 20, 2008. Lance &amp; Emy
        have three children together; Jacob,
        Leilani and Hannah. He is retired
        from the Navy. He is working and
      attending college. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>My
        daughter Kimberly was born April
        22, 1969 and has three boys, Giovanni Escobar,
        Jesse Escobar (who live on their own)
        and Gerael Jones, and one daughter, Esm&eacute; Shults.
        Kim graduated from law school
      in California two years ago.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I
        have raised goats, kept sheep, raised chickens, and
        had vegetable gardens. I sew, knit, crochet, spin and
        weave. I have experience building sheds and other things
        out of wood. I can replace a broken window and lay
        a linoleum floor and install a toilet. I used to make
        repairs to my car, before they were electronic.
        I studied Karate for a year and Aikido for two years.
        I am writing and illustrating a book about my family
        history which goes back to 1370. I also design web pages.      </p>
      <p>I have an affinity for children,
          and get along well with almost all children. I have many interests,
        which change often.&nbsp;I
        like to swim for exercise.
        I belong to a spinning guild
        and a weaver&rsquo;s
        guild. I have taken the Landmark
        Education curriculum. I took
        the leadership training class
        in the fall of 2003. These
        courses have transformed my
        life and have been extremely
        helpful in my customer service
      work.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>I
        have always been interested
        in human nature, and have read
        many books on the subject,
        and taken college classes in
        psychology, child development,
      sociology and anthropology. I have accumulated 230 college credits. </p>
      <p>I have also been on a lifelong
        spiritual quest to find the
        answers to the big questions:
        Who am I?&nbsp; Why
        am I here? What is my relationship
        to God? I have studied extensively
        and have arrived at a philosophy
        about these things that satisfies
      me.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I
        am a Seven Rays Energy Healer. I have gotten
        very good results from the healings I have given.
        If you are ill, please feel free to call me and
        request a healing. I can send a healing from
      a distance. &nbsp;</p>      
      <p>Life
    just keeps getting better all the time. My philosophy of life is: &quot;All you need is love.&quot; </p></td>
