Dear Family Member,
 
Welcome!
 
You are registered on the Forbes-Kimball-Family Website.
 
We hope you find this website useful and enjoyable.
 
If you see an inaccuracy, please email us and we will make the correction. Use the link on the website.
 
If you have an idea about something to add to this website, please tell us by email.
 
We invite everyone who is a part of the family to write a biography to be linked to you on the website.  If you would like help writing it, Carolyn will be happy to do that. Send her an email and she will arrange a time to interview you. Please include your phone number.
 
We are not getting any younger, so if you are interested in being involved in maintaining this website when we are gone, let us know. We envision a sort of internship to train you. If you have experience at writing or maintaining websites, and are committed to contributing to the family, that is ideal.  
 
This is a secure website. Access is granted by Lou or Carolyn after you register. If you are not a member of the family, or married to someone who is, you would not qualify. Also, not everyone who is a family member will be granted access. The safety and security of the people who use this website is primary.
 
Once again, Welcome!
 
Your Webmasters,
Carolyn Forbes, daughter of Mary and George
And
Louie Wilson. Husband of Carolyn.
